# scribus-plugin-API

A stable, high level and documented interface to the Scribus core that plugin developers can use to access the Scribus features.

# Roadmap

- [x] setup the plugin
- [ ] activate a first class and method and try to call it from another plugin
- [ ] setup a documentation framework (probably QDoc)
- [ ] move the epub's plugin `ScribusDocument` class to the `ScribusAPI`
- [ ] make more publicity for this project and find out how to improve its architecture / add more coverage of Scribus features.
